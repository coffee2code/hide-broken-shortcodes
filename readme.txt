Prevent broken shortcodes from appearing in posts and pages.


== Description ==

By default in WordPress, if the plugin that provides the functionality to handle any given shortcode is disabled, or if a shortcode is improperly defined in the content (such as with a typo), then the shortcode in question will appear on the site in its entirety, unprocessed by WordPress. At best this reveals unsightly code-like text to visitors and at worst can potentially expose information not intended to be seen by visitors.

This plugin prevents unhandled shortcodes from appearing in the content of a post or page. If the shortcode is of the self-closing variety, then the shortcode tag and its attributes are not displayed and nothing is shown in their place. If the shortcode is of the enclosing variety (an opening and closing tag bookend some text or markup), then the text that is being enclosed will be shown, but the shortcode tag and attributes that surround the text will not be displayed.

See the Filters section for more customization tips.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `hide-broken-shortcodes.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. Optionally filter 'hide_broken_shortcode' or 'hide_broken_shortcodes_filters' if you want to customize the behavior of the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I type out a shortcode in a post so that it doesn't get processed by WordPress or hidden by this plugin? =

If you want want a shortcode to appear as-is in a post (for example, you are trying to provide an example of how to use a shortcode), can use the shortcode escaping syntax, which is built into WordPress, by using two opening brackets to start the shortcode, and two closing brackets to close the shortcode:

* `[[some_shortcode]]`
* `[[an_example style="yes"]some text[/an_example]]`

The shortcodes will appear in your post (but without the double brackets).

= How can I prevent certain broken shortcodes from being hidden? =

Assuming you want to allow the broken shortcodes 'abc' and 'gallery' to be ignored by this plugin (and therefore not hidden if broken), you can include the following in your theme's functions.php file or in a site-specific plugin:

`
function allowed_broken_shortcodes( $display, $shortcode_name, $m ) {
	$shortcodes_not_to_hide = array( 'abc', 'gallery' );
	if ( in_array( $shortcode_name, $shortcodes_not_to_hide ) ) {
		$display = $m[0];
	}
	return $display;
}
add_filter( 'hide_broken_shortcode', 'allowed_broken_shortcodes', 10, 3 );
`

= Does this plugin include unit tests? =

Yes.


== Filters ==

The plugin is further customizable via two filters. Typically, these customizations would be put into your active theme's functions.php file, or used by another plugin.

= hide_broken_shortcode =

The 'hide_broken_shortcode' filter allows you to customize what, if anything, gets displayed when a broken shortcode is encountered. Your hooking function can be sent 3 arguments:

Arguments :

* $default (string): The default display text (what the plugin would display by default)
* $shortcode (string): The name of the shortcode
* The text bookended by opening and closing broken shortcodes, if present

Example:

`
/**
 * Don't show broken shortcodes or the content they wrap.
 *
 * @param string $default The output the plugin would normally show.
 * @param string $shortcode The name of the shortcode.
 * @param string $content The text between the opening and closing "tags" of the shortcode, if any.
 * @return string
 */
function hbs_handler( $default, $shortcode, $content ) {
	return ''; // Don't show the shortcode or text bookended by the shortcode
}
add_filter( 'hide_broken_shortcode', 'hbs_handler', 10, 3 );
`

= hide_broken_shortcodes_filters =

The 'hide_broken_shortcodes_filters' filter allows you to customize what filters to hook to find text with potential broken shortcodes. The three default filters are 'the_content', 'the_excerpt', and 'widget_text'. Your hooking function will only be sent one argument: the array of filters.

Example:

`
/**
 * Make Hide Broken Shortcodes also filter 'the_title'.
 *
 * @param  array $filters_array The filters the plugin will handle.
 * @return array
 */
function hbs_filter( $filters_array ) {
	$filters_array[] = 'the_title'; // Assuming you've activated shortcode support in post titles
	return $filters_array;
}
add_filter( 'hide_broken_shortcodes_filters', 'hbs_filter' );
`
